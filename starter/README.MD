# Project express API

> The goal of this project is to practice how to structure a production express API.

The final project should expose an API for your projects table from your supabase, mainly, a restful CRUD API (i.e., create, read, update, delete).

**TODOs**:

- [ ] Explore the files of the project and complete the missing parts
- [ ] The project might have issue with es6 imports of some packages, so check the documentation and fix any issues
- [ ] You also need to explore the docs of the packages to get familiar with their APIs
- [ ] The rest API should be secure with a Bearer Authorization
